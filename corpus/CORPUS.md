<!-- BEGIN ANALYSIS -->

## Analysis

**8/8 rendered without a panic or a hung fetch** — the headline robustness
signal. Numbers above are from the run *after* the one bug this corpus found.

### Bug found and fixed: nested `<table>` swallowed whole (Hacker News)

First run: `news.ycombinator.com` produced 3 pages, page 1 blank below the
header, and only 1363 characters of extracted text. HN's markup is the
classic layout-table trick — the entire story list is one `<tr><td>` whose
cell holds a *second*, real `<table>` of 30 story rows. `collectAtoms`
treated any `<tr>` as one indivisible pagination atom without recursing into
it, so that outer row became a single atom the height of the *whole nested
table* — taller than a page, so it could only start at a page top, and
everything before it was wasted blank space on page 1.

Fix: a `<tr>` only counts as one atom when it has no `<tr>` *inside* it
(`hasDescendantTr` in `html2pdf.go`); a layout-table wrapper row is descended
into instead, so its real rows become the atoms. After the fix: 4 pages,
content from the top of page 1, 4009 characters extracted (~3×). Regression
test: `TestExportNestedLayoutTableSplitsAcrossPages`.

### Fixed: narrow print column vs. desktop-only responsive CSS (`Options.ViewportPx`)

`rfc-editor.org`'s RFC 9110 page rendered technically correctly but
inefficiently: 428 pages for a document whose official PDF runs closer to
180. The page's table-of-contents sidebar sits *beside* the article in a
fixed-width column with no breakpoint that drops it below desktop width, so
laying out directly at html2pdf's print column (170mm, ≈642px) squeezed the
prose to under half the page width — roughly double the line count it needed.

Fix: `Export` now lays out at a wider virtual viewport (`Options.ViewportPx`,
default 1024px) and scales the whole page down to fit the print column,
same idea as a browser print dialog's "shrink to fit". Result, this run vs.
the one that found the problem:

| Page | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| RFC 9110 | 428 pages | **120 pages** |
| `pkg.go.dev/net/http` | 86 | 49 |
| Wikipedia (Go) | 34 | 18 |
| Wikipedia (countries list) | 17 | 9 |
| `go.dev/blog` | 9 | 6 |
| Hacker News | 4 | 2 |
| `react.dev` | 7 | 5 |

Extracted text length stayed within 1% on every page — this is a layout
density change, not a content change. `out/www-rfc-editor-org-rfc-rfc9110-html-p1-001.png`
and `out/news-ycombinator-com-p1-1.png` after the fix both show full-width,
readable text at a normal size — the scale-down doesn't make anything too
small to read at these ratios (642/1024 ≈ 0.63×).

### Confirmed-expected: `react.dev` shows only its static shell

7 pages of real content (nav, hero, first section, one code sample) — the
part of the page that ships in the HTML itself. No JavaScript runs, so
nothing that hydrates client-side appears. This is the documented scope
limitation working as expected, not a failure.
